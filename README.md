## Stakeholders
- Museums
- International Council of Museums

## Near Vision
### First Sprint
- Database Design and implementation 
- Preliminary front-end design of the web app
- Creating function prototypes in the back-end and connecting them to the web app
- Linking the database with the back-end 

### Second Sprint
- front-end design of the mobile app 
- implementing the feature to browse the list of the musuems 
- implementing the feature of displaying museum locations on a map

## Product Backlog Rationale
Backlog items are prioritised based on their business value to stakeholders, with certain things receiving higher priority than others due to the potential for a higher return on investment. Also, in the case of little stories, if one story is dependent on another, the latter should be completed first.

## Additional Notes
- Sprint Duration of 2 weeks
- The team can handle about 45 story points per sprint 
- For a productive working day with all members working for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week, they can achieve from 4 to 5 story points a day. 

## Convention
It has been decided to use the Fibonacci numbers to decide the story points for a given story according to the table: 

| Story Points | Story Type |
|--------------|------------|
| 5            | Very Small |
| 8            | Small      |
| 13           | Medium     |
| 20           | Large      |
| 40           | Very Large |
